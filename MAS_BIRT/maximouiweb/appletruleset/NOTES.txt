Using certificate hashes will cause problems.

1. In IE, it will cause Maximo to invalidate the session, because the APPLET will make a call back to the server using the same url
that it was invoked with, which is the "loadapp" url, and that invalidates the session.  This is a scenario where an
arbitrary hash exists in the rules BEFORE your IP rule.

2. In all browsers, using a hash, instead of an ip/host value, will give a LiveConnect permission issue.

Both of these appear to be Java Plugin bugs
